## Project Description
This project explores the financial implications of the Indonesian government's use of e-materai in the CPNS 2024 (Civil Servant Candidate Selection) process. By analyzing the data of CPNS applicants, this project aims to reveal how the mandatory purchase of e-materai contributes to government revenue. Additionally, the project questions the fairness of charging applicants before they have even passed initial stages of the selection process.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the significant revenue generated by the government through the use of e-materai in the CPNS process, while also addressing concerns over the financial burden it places on job seekers. The analysis demonstrates that the mandatory e-materai should be reconsidered, particularly for applicants who have yet to pass initial selection stages, to avoid unnecessary financial strain on the public.
